<body><H3>Davif Goggins.Mix.Charles Bukowski.Marco Pierre White</H3><p title="normal">We don't rise to the level of our expectations, we fall to the level of our training.You are in danger of living a life so comfortable and soft, that you will die wihout ever realizing your true potential. It won't always go your way, so you can't get trapped in this idea that just because you jave imagined a possibility for yourself, that you somehow deserve it. Your way also means that slight difference, because of which you give up workout out, because the part where you imagine 100 workout without the capability (which comes from expereince registering it) of thinking the feeling of the actual feeling after a few reps, where my count starts, is not included in the actual experience, because of which it is called not-going-your way. It is as simple as that. Then apply the bukowki's theorem of understanding this, and going all the way to a solitube point, which will register this new experience and complete my 100 reps in one go. Your entitled mind (handed to us in school, gov, reilgion, family) is a dead weight. Cut it loose. Don't focus on what you think you desrve. Take aim on what you are willing to earn, that is write, there is not learn. There is work and earn (work and eat,sleep). The earning abstraction implements into eating, sexing, and arting and killing. </p><p title="brown">I have finally graduated from 'I don't give a hoot'. Children read books, not reviews. They don't gie a hoot about critics.You only have to go hardcore humilaion on the first time. On the subsequent sequels, you can coast. The horse does what he thinks he's supposed to do, or he does what he thinks he needs to do to survive. Whether I scare some people or not, I don't give a hoot. If you are not scared by now, nothing can scare you.  Inadqueacy of his own strength, leaned from experience, impels and urges a man to enlis the help of others (called whining and bing needy...the enlisiting part).I am not going to worry about what people think, I don't give a hoot. Remember, it is a consious effort. </p><p title="blue">I don't hate them. I just feel better when they are not around. For those who believe in the god-shit, most of the big questions are answered. For me, the big answers don't remain stone-written. I adjust to new conditions and discoveries. [notice it doesn't sound right]. That is because, I never adjust. We adjust...So, lets say that again. We adjust to new conditions and discoveries. We are pliable. Love need not be a command nor faith a dictum. I am my own god. We are here to unlearn the teachings of the church, state and our educational system. Sometimes you climb out of bed  and think, I am not going to make it, but you laugh-remembering all the times you have felt that way.  If you are going to try, go all the way. Otherwise don't even start. This could mean not having girlfriends, relatives and maybe even your mind. It could mean not eating for three or four days. It could mean freezing on a park bench. It could mean jail. It could mean <u>derision</u>. It could mean mockery--isolation. Isolation is he gift. All the others are a test of your endurance, of how much you really want to do it. And you will do it, despite rejection and the worst odds. Ad it will be better than anything else you can imagine. If you are going to try, go all the way. There is no other feeling like that. You will be alone, and the nights will flame with fire. You will ride life straight to perfect laughter. It's the only good fight there is.</p><p title="gray">You cannot criticize a man for going to work. You really cannot. (Your) rudeness is (you) not having fun. It is at the expense of another person (me). Remember, restuaranteurs are only shopkeepers. Restaurants are no different from the supermarkets down the road.We all make misakes. I have made more than anyone else I know.</p></body></html>
